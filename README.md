This repository contains the scripts implemented using jupyter notebook for the machine learning lab class
 
- Train a linear regression algorithm to predict a person's health insurance premium accurately
  Tensorflow and Keras env were used

- Analyze a large time series dataset
  'Household Electric Power Consumption from Kaggle' was used.
  Necessary preprocessing techniques  were performed on the dataset for time series analysis.
  LSTM (Large Short Term Memory) model was created and model was trained based on the TensorFlow keras library.
  The model performance was evaluated.
